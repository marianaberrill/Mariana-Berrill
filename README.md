# Mariana-Berrill
I am a level 4 student at Leeds beckett
I have gained a lot of programming skills over the past two years, such as my first project being creating a website where I used HTML and some CSS. This was for a college project, so I understand the basics of using HTML. My next project I worked on was for a graphical user interface using SQLite and C# programming language. I understand the basic skills of C# and using SQLite. Doing these separate projects at a somewhat basic level has helped me develop my skills gradually and have a ground understanding, so therfore I know a bit of a few languages which can be very beneficial to me to adapt to learning new programming languages.
I have also worked on an API project during my internship at Lloyd's banking group, this has helped me immensly to be in a real work environment with using my programming skills, which gave me a base level understanding of Python and including methodologies such as agile. This has also given me the skills to enable me to work with other developers and get knowledge and skills from them that I can apply in my work too. 
My latest project being the project with Leeds Beckett University to create a program that can run in the command line, and working on notebooks to ensure all of my skills learnt through lectures and research can be applied. This language is Python, which is essential as Python is the fundamental language and one of the most popular programming languages.
